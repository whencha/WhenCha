  <h1>WhenCha — tea as a state</h1>
  <p>
    We often don’t notice how the most important moments of life happen with a cup in hand.
    Coffee — before everything changes. A cup of tea in a kitchen that smells like bread and sunlight. 
    Matcha — to gather strength for the new day...
  </p>
  <p>
    This brand is not about a perfect lifestyle. It’s about what’s real. And that’s where my path began.
  </p>
  <h2>Values:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Slowness — to hear yourself</li>
    <li>Maturity — with love for yourself and your story</li>
    <li>Home & light — not as a place, but as a feeling</li>
    <li>Sincerity & naturalness</li>
    <li>Acceptance — of pain, joy, change</li>
    <li>Attention to detail — because that’s where the realness lives</li>
  </ul>
